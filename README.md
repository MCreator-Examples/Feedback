# WELCOME MCREATOR EXAMPLES FEEDBACK
This repository is for tutorial requests for project files in [This Repository](https://github.com/MCreator-Examples/Projects) where I provide tutorial workspaces and project files. You can request a tutorial to be updated/patched or a new idea not yet created.

# SEARCH BEFORE YOU POST
Search my channel to check to see if the tutorial has already been made also search this repository using filters and keywords for any open or closed issues. This helps keep doubles down and makes less work for me to go through when I need to look for a new idea for an advanced tutorial.

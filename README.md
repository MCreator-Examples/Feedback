# WELCOME MCREATOR EXAMPLES FEEDBACK
## BEFORE YOU PROVIDE A ISSUE OR SUGGESTION
There are some steps you should preform before you make a new thread.  
This helps keep duplicates down saving me more time and hastle to sort issues.

## GETTING STARTED
### STEP 1 - Checking if the tutorial has been done before.
To know if the tutorial has been made before check my MCreator playlists on my channel. This can let you check if the tutorial still works or if you need to open a update tutorial suggestion instead.

### STEP 2 - Check if the suggestion has already been added.
To lower the work for me to manage duplicate suggestions make sure you check closed issues and issues still open. If the issue is closed most likely I have left a reason why its been closed or linked to the tutorial I made when I closed it. If the tutorial is outdated or broken you may just check if the suggestion is open.

### STEP 3 - Picking the right issue type.
There are some issue types you can pick from but the only two that should be used are below.  

#### Tutorial Requests
The reasons why you would use this issue type are for the following reasons.
1. The tutorial has not been made yet
2. Your idea is an expansion of a tutorial already made.
- [Create New Tutorial Request](https://github.com/MCreator-Examples/Feedback/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Tutorial-Request%2C+Submitted&template=tutorial-requests.yml)

#### Tutorial Update
The reasons why you would use this issue type are for the following reasons.
1. A tutorial no longer works with newer versions of MCreator.
- [Create New Update Request](https://github.com/MCreator-Examples/Feedback/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Tutorial-Update%2C+Submitted&template=tutorial-update.yml)

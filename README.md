# WELCOME MCREATOR EXAMPLES FEEDBACK
This repository is use for sharing your ideas for possible future [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/) tutorials. 
  
You can find a data base of all existing ideas on [this page](https://github.com/MCreator-Examples/Feedback/issues?page=6&q=). 
  
Some older tutorial projects may have not been migrated yet but can be found on my [blog post](https://www.northwesttreesgaming.com/post/20220530-older-workspace-downloads).  
These tutorials will be remade and migrated when I have time.

***

## WHERE TO FIND PROJECT WORKSPACES
You can find project workspace over on the `projects repository` on the [discussions tab](https://github.com/MCreator-Examples/Projects/discussions).

***

## WHAT IS THE REPOSITORY FOR?
- A place for my community to `report broken example workspace` that I have made.
- A place for my community to `suggest new tutorial ideas` or `expand existing ones`.

*** 

## BEFORE YOU PROVIDE A ISSUE OR SUGGESTION
There are some steps you should preform before you make a new thread.  
This helps keep duplicates down saving me more time and hastle to sort issues.

### STEPS
1. Check NorthWestTrees Gaming [MCreator playlists](https://www.youtube.com/c/NorthWestTreesGaming/playlists?view=50&shelf_id=8) to see if the tutorial has already been made.
    - If the tutorial has already been made and the version of MCreator is outdated.
    - Test the provided workspace in the project download to see if it is in working order for your MCreator/Minecraft version.
    - If the project workspace provided in the download is is not working like the tutorial then move to Step 2.
2. Check [this page](https://github.com/orgs/MCreator-Examples/projects/7/views/1?groupedBy%5BcolumnId%5D=Status&sortedBy%5Bdirection%5D=asc&sortedBy%5BcolumnId%5D=Title) if the suggestion has already been suggested.
    - If the issue is closed
      - Check to see why the issue was closed, most of the time I leave a comment.
      - Open a new issue if I have not stated that I won't be fixing the issue.
      - Keep in mind that all tutorial updates are for the latest version of MCreator.
    - If the issue is open.
      - Leave a comment with any aditional suggestion that are not already listed.
